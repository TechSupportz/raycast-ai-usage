# AI Usage

Raycast extension for checking your Codex and Claude Code usage limits from the command palette.

## What it shows

For each account, one section listing its main rate-limit windows:

- **Codex** — the 5-hour and weekly limits, plus banked usage resets
- **Claude Code** — the session and weekly limits, plus available saved usage resets

Every window shows how much you have left, coloured by how close you are to the limit. Its reset time appears when the provider reports a machine-readable timestamp.

## Multiple Codex accounts

Codex account discovery and switching require [codex-auth](https://github.com/loongphy/codex-auth). Install it globally with npm or Bun:

```bash
npm install -g @loongphy/codex-auth
# or
bun add -g @loongphy/codex-auth
```

Sign in to each account with `codex-auth`, then confirm they appear:

```bash
codex-auth login
codex-auth list
```

Every managed account appears automatically in Raycast. Use **Switch to This Account** to make one active, or **Rename Account** to give an email a shorter display name.

## Requirements

- macOS
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)
- For Codex limits: [codex-auth](https://github.com/loongphy/codex-auth) installed globally with at least one signed-in account
- For Claude Code limits: [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed and signed in

## Credentials

Codex credentials stay owned by `codex-auth`. The extension reads its account registry and asks `codex-auth` to switch the active account. Claude Code is refreshed directly using its stored OAuth refresh token, without making an inference request. The extension coordinates with Claude Code's refresh lock, re-reads credentials after acquiring it, and saves rotated credentials back to the same source before using them.

Claude Code credentials are read from the macOS Keychain, falling back to `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.

## Usage

1. Install `codex-auth` and sign in to your Codex accounts.
2. Install the extension in Raycast.
3. Run `View AI Usage`.
4. Review your limits. `⌘R` refreshes.

## Troubleshooting

**A codex-auth account is missing** — confirm it appears in `codex-auth list`.

**codex-auth will not load** — confirm `codex-auth list` works in Terminal, or reinstall it using one of the commands above.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
